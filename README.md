# Automated Testing Demo Project

![Build Status](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY/actions/workflows/ci-cd.yml/badge.svg)
![Test Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-95%25-brightgreen)

This project demonstrates the implementation of automated testing in a GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline as part of Assignment 5.

## Project Overview

This is a simple Node.js application that includes:
- Basic web server using Express
- Utility functions for mathematical calculations
- User management functionality
- Comprehensive test suite (unit and integration tests)
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing gates

## Features

- **Calculator Module**: Basic arithmetic operations
- **User Service**: User registration and validation
- **Web Server**: Simple REST API endpoints
- **Automated Testing**: Unit and integration tests with Jest
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Build → Test → Release workflow

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd automated-testing-demo

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start the application
npm start

# Run in development mode
npm run dev
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests only
npm run test:integration

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Building

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Build**: Install dependencies and build the application
2. **Test**: Run automated tests (unit and integration)
3. **Release**: Deploy to staging/production (only if tests pass)

### Workflow Features

- Automated testing on every push to main branch
- Test failure prevention of deployments
- Multi-environment deployment (staging → production)
- Test coverage reporting
- Build artifacts management
